= Sanger::Rack::Authentication::SSO

This app is a piece of Rack Middleware to abstract the Single Sign-On used
by the Sanger Institute.

It may or (more likely) may not work with other SSO solutions.

At this moment, see the tests for the settings that need to be passed in when
using this middleware in a Rackup file or similar.
